# Rhythm of Three 
Stylised audio visualizer in Three.js

The algorithm for this is from https://codepen.io/prakhar625 's audio visualizer codepen in which I altered the source code a little to suit my style of design and way of function. Click on anywhere on the screen to play and once more to pause.

Try it out on https://jsfiddle.net/bentoBAUX/839b7q5p/12/ (you will still need to run this code locally as you'll need to have a local audio file)!

### Known complications with the project:

Due to Chrome's autoplay policy, audio does not play when clicking the screen. A fix I use for this is to run Live Server on VSCode for this project, change something in the code and undo the change for the project to refresh. Audio plays now :D

Perhaps using this method to enable audio playback isn't the ideal way but I wanted to keep things clean for this project (didn't want to have so many buttons around) so I resorted to this method.
