# Rhythm of Three 
Stylized audio visualiser in Three.js

The algorithm for this is from https://codepen.io/prakhar625 's audio visualiser fiddle in which I altered the source code a little to suit my style of design and way of function. Click on anywhere on the screen to play and once more to pause.

Try it out on https://jsfiddle.net/bentoBAUX/839b7q5p/12/ (you will still need to run this code locally as you'll need to have a local music file)!
